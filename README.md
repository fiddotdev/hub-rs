# hub-rs

hub-rs is a barebones Rust library for interacting with [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz) hubs

All definitions and functions are auto-generated with [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)

Protobufs are provided from the [Farcaster monorepo](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo)

## How to use
First, install the crate:

`hub-rs = { version = "0.01" }`  OR `cargo add hub-rs`

Then, you can use it in your project. To create a client, and get info about the connected hub, you might write something like this:
```rust
use hub_rs::hub_service_client::HubServiceClient;
use hub_rs::HubInfoRequest;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Secure or insecure connections are defined by the protocol you provide, either http or https
    let mut client = HubServiceClient::connect("https://mainnet.useportals.app:2283").await?;

    let info = client.get_info(HubInfoRequest { db_stats: true }).await?;


    println!("{:?}", info.into_inner());

    Ok(())
}
```

## Additional Functions Provided
Currently, two extra functions are provided for QOL:
- `bytes_to_hex_string` - Converts `Vec<u8>` or `[u8; 32/64]` types to a hex string
- `hex_string_to_bytes` - Converts a hex string into `Vec<u8>`

## FAQ

Q:  Why?

A: ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Q: Is this faster than hub-nodejs?

A: Theoretically, yes, just due to the nature of Rust. However, the difference is probably minimal, since its majorly just requests, real bottleneck is I/O & internet speed.
